`/age2` will display a simple in-game instance time.

`/borderless` will toggle borderless window; alternatively, you can use `/borderless on` or `/borderless off`.

* `/cam unlock` and `/cam lock` to lock/unlock camera.
* `/cam speed [value]` sets the unlocked camera speed.
* `/cam fog on` or `/cam fog off` to enable or disable fog.
* `/cam fov [amount]` to change the Field-of-View, or `/cam fov` default to reset it.

`/flag clear` to unflag all heroes.

`/pcons` will toggle [pcons](pcons); alternatively, you can use `/pcons on` or `/pcons off`.

`/target` or `/tgt` has few advanced ways to interact with your target:
* `/target closest` or `/target nearest` will target the closest agent to the player.
* `/target getid` will print the the target model ID (aka PlayerNumber). This is unique and constant for each kind of agent.
* `/target getpos` will print the coordinates (x, y) of the target.

`/tb close`, `/tb quit`, or `/tb exit` completely close Toolbox and all its windows.

`/tb reset` moves [Settings](settings) and the main Toolbox window to the top-left corner of the screen.

`/hide [name]` or `/show [name]` to hide or show a window or widget, or `/tb [name]` to toggle.

`/tb` to hide or show the main Toolbox window.

`resize [x] [y]` sets the size of the Guild Wars window if the resolution is set to Window.

`/to [dest]`, `/tp [dest]`, or `/travel [dest]` will map travel you to the `[dest]` outpost. You can use the following values instead of `[dest]`:
* `toa`
* `doa`
* `kamadan` or `kama`
* `embark`
* `eee`
* `vlox` or `vloxs`
* `gadd` or `gadds`
* `urgoz`

* `fav1`, `fav2`, `fav3` for your favorite locations
* `gh` for your guild hall
* `gh [tag]` for any guild hall in your alliance - the tag is not case sensitive.

You can also specify the district with a third argument: possible values are `ae1`, `ee1`, `eg1` (or `dd1`) and `int`. For example, `/tp embark ee1` will make you travel to Embark Beach Europe English District 1.

`/useskill [slot]` will use the selected skill on recharge; for example, `/useskill 1` will use your first skill. Use `/useskill`, `/useskill 0`, or `/useskill stop` to stop.

`/transmo` changes your character model to that of the target NPC. This is only visible to you, and will persist until you zone, use a tonic, or `/transmo` something else.
* `/transmo [number between 6 and 255]` sets the size of your model. Again, this has no effect except your appearance on your own screen.

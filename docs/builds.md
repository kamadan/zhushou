# Builds
The Builds window allows you to create and edit teambuilds, which can then be sent directly to party chat. Clicking on the name of one of your teambuilds will send the name, followed by each build in a loadable template.

To create a new teambuild, click "Add Teambuild", or "Edit" to edit an existing teambuild. This will open a new window, which can be independently moved and re-sized. You can have multiple windows open at once. In these windows, you can write the name of the team and the individual builds, and paste in the template codes.

The "Send" buttons send individual builds to chat, and the Xs delete the build.

You can add as many builds as you want to the teambuild.

"Show numbers" adds a number to the name of each build.

If you leave a template code blank, it will simply appear as a message, instead of a blank template, and will not be given a number. This is useful for sending general instructions to the whole team, for example.

"Up" and "Down" change the teambuild's position in the list of teambuilds, and "Delete" will delete the entire teambuild from the list.
